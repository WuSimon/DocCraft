# DocCraft Presentation Roadmap (15 minutes)

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the structure and content for a 15-minute presentation about the DocCraft Python package, covering its purpose, technical implementation, examples, visualizations, and development insights.

## Presentation Structure

### 1. Introduction & Purpose (2-3 minutes)
**What is DocCraft?**
- A modular document processing toolkit for document understanding and question answering
- Supports multiple AI parsers (DeepSeekVL, QwenVL, LayoutLMv3) and traditional OCR (Tesseract, PaddleOCR)
- Designed for document VQA (Visual Question Answering) tasks
- Built with extensibility and benchmarking in mind

**Key Problems Solved:**
- Document understanding across different formats (PDFs, images)
- Question answering on document content
- Performance comparison between different AI models
- Standardized evaluation metrics for document VQA

### 2. Technical Architecture (3-4 minutes)
**Modular Design:**
- **Parsers**: AI-powered (DeepSeekVL, QwenVL, LayoutLMv3) and traditional (Tesseract, PaddleOCR)
- **Preprocessors**: Image and PDF preprocessing capabilities
- **Postprocessors**: Text and table postprocessing
- **Benchmarkers**: Accuracy and performance evaluation tools

**Core Components:**
- Parser Registry system for easy extension
- Unified CLI interface (`doccraft benchmark`, `doccraft evaluate`)
- Standardized output formats for predictions and evaluations
- Configurable pipeline architecture

**Technical Stack:**
- Python 3.10+
- Transformers library for AI models
- OpenCV, PIL for image processing
- PDFPlumber for PDF extraction
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations

### 3. Examples & Demo (3-4 minutes)
**CLI Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Single parser benchmark
doccraft benchmark --ground_truth data/gt.json --documents images/ --parser deepseekvl --max_questions 100

# Multi-parser evaluation
doccraft evaluate --results results1.json results2.json --visualize

# Pipeline usage
doccraft --input document.pdf --parser layoutlmv3 --preprocessor pdf
```

**Code Examples:**
- Basic parser usage
- Custom pipeline creation
- Benchmarking workflow
- Results analysis

### 4. Results & Visualizations (2-3 minutes)
**Benchmark Results:**
- Show comparison table of the three AI parsers (DeepSeekVL, QwenVL, LayoutLMv3)
- Display bar charts showing:
  - Exact match rates
  - Normalized match rates
  - Similarity breakdowns (High/Med/Low/NoMatch)
  - Average similarity scores

**Performance Metrics:**
- Processing times comparison
- Accuracy vs. speed trade-offs
- Model confidence levels

**Key Findings:**
- QwenVL shows best overall performance (43.9% total match rate)
- DeepSeekVL and LayoutLMv3 have different strengths
- Processing time varies significantly between models

### 5. Development Lessons & Challenges (2-3 minutes)
**Technical Challenges:**
- **Model Integration**: Managing different AI model requirements and dependencies
- **Memory Management**: Large models require careful memory handling
- **Path Handling**: Dealing with different file path conventions across datasets
- **Output Standardization**: Creating unified formats for different parser outputs

**Architecture Decisions:**
- **Modular Design**: Benefits of plugin-style architecture for easy extension
- **CLI vs. Library**: Dual interface for different use cases
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for production use
- **Progress Reporting**: User-friendly progress indicators for long-running tasks

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Documentation**: Importance of comprehensive CLI help and examples
- **Testing**: Need for both unit tests and integration tests
- **Performance**: Trade-offs between accuracy and processing speed
- **User Experience**: Progress reporting and clear error messages matter

**Future Improvements:**
- GPU acceleration support
- More AI model integrations
- Web interface for easier usage
- Distributed processing capabilities
