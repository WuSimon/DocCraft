- **Preprocessing**: Image enhancement (deskew, binarization), PDF splitting, and format conversion.
- **AI Integration**: Wrappers for models like LayoutLMv3 and DeepSeek-VL for structured text extraction and multimodal understanding.
- **Postprocessing**: Text cleanup, table formatting, and output standardization (JSON/CSV).
- **Benchmarking**: Performance metrics and comparison tools for different parsing methods and configurations.
- **DocVQA Integration**: Standardized evaluation against the DocVQA dataset for real-world benchmarking.

**Use Case**: Streamline document parsing workflows for developers/researchers working with scanned documents or PDFs, with a focus on performance optimization and measurable results.

## Design Principles: Modularity & Object-Oriented Architecture âœ… IMPLEMENTED

- âœ… Each major functionality (parsing, preprocessing, postprocessing, benchmarking) is a separate subpackage.
- âœ… All algorithms/utilities are implemented as classes or functions in their own modules.
- âœ… Base classes/interfaces are defined for each component type (e.g., BaseParser, BasePreprocessor, BasePostprocessor).
- âœ… Each implementation is a subclass (e.g., TesseractOCRParser, BinarizationPreprocessor).
- âœ… Users can import and compose only the modules they need.
- âœ… Pipelines can be constructed by chaining objects (e.g., PreprocessingPipeline, Parser, PostprocessingPipeline).
- âœ… The API exposes a simple way to build and run pipelines, allowing users to select and configure modules via code or config.
- âœ… All modules and options are documented for discoverability and ease of use.
