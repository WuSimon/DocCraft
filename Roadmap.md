# DocCraft Roadmap

## Package Summary
**Purpose**: A Python package for intelligent document parsing and preprocessing, offering a unified interface for OCR, PDF extraction, AI model integration, and comprehensive benchmarking. DocCraft transforms complex document workflows into streamlined, measurable processes.

**Key Features**:
- **Unified API**: Simplify usage of OCR engines (Tesseract, PaddleOCR) and PDF libraries (PyMuPDF, pdfplumber).
- **Preprocessing**: Image enhancement (deskew, binarization), PDF splitting, and format conversion.
- **AI Integration**: Wrappers for models like LayoutLM or Donut for structured text extraction.
- **Postprocessing**: Text cleanup, table formatting, and output standardization (JSON/CSV).
- **Benchmarking**: Performance metrics and comparison tools for different parsing methods and configurations.

**Use Case**: Streamline document parsing workflows for developers/researchers working with scanned documents or PDFs, with a focus on performance optimization and measurable results.

## Phase 1: Core Setup & Basic Parsers (1-2 Weeks)
- [ ] Initialize repo with `setup.py`, dependencies, and package structure.  
- [ ] Implement core document parsers:  
  - [ ] **Tesseract OCR**: Text extraction from images/PDFs.  
  - [ ] **PyMuPDF**: Fast PDF text and metadata extraction.  
- [ ] Add basic preprocessing:  
  - [ ] Image deskewing/binarization (OpenCV).  
  - [ ] PDF-to-image conversion (`pdf2image`).  
- [ ] Minimal postprocessing:  
  - [ ] Regex-based text cleanup (dates, invoices).  
- [ ] Write unit tests (pytest).  
- [ ] Set up basic benchmarking framework:
  - [ ] Define key performance metrics (speed, accuracy, memory usage).
  - [ ] Create benchmark dataset with various document types.

## Phase 2: Advanced Parsers & Preprocessing (2-3 Weeks)  
- [ ] Add deep learning model integrations:  
  - [ ] **LayoutLM** (Hugging Face Transformers for structured text).  
  - [ ] **OCRmyPDF** wrapper for OCR-backed PDFs.  
- [ ] Advanced preprocessing:  
  - [ ] Table detection (using `Camelot` or `tabula-py`).  
  - [ ] Document splitting by sections/pages.  
- [ ] Postprocessing expansion:  
  - [ ] Table-to-CSV conversion.  
  - [ ] JSON schema standardization (e.g., for invoices).  
- [ ] Expand benchmarking suite:
  - [ ] Compare performance across different OCR engines.
  - [ ] Benchmark preprocessing pipeline efficiency.
  - [ ] Create performance comparison reports.

## Phase 3: Usability & Deployment (1 Week)  
- [ ] Write documentation (README, examples, API docs).  
- [ ] Publish to PyPI via `twine`.  
- [ ] Add CI/CD (GitHub Actions for automated testing).  
- [ ] Create demo scripts for common workflows.  
- [ ] Document benchmarking results and best practices:
  - [ ] Create benchmark visualization tools.
  - [ ] Add performance optimization guidelines.

## Future Enhancements  
- [ ] Support AWS Textract/Google Vision API integrations.  
- [ ] Add a CLI for non-Python users.  
- [ ] Dockerize for easy deployment.  
- [ ] Continuous benchmarking integration:
  - [ ] Automated performance regression testing.
  - [ ] Real-time performance monitoring tools.
